This is what you should see:\n\nTo establish an SSH connection with your Raspberry Pi, enter the following command:\nssh pi@raspberrypi\nVideo\n\n\nStep 4: Locating Your Raspberry Pi’s IP Address using MAC Address (If needed)\nYou can determine your Raspberry Pi’s IP address using its MAC address. Here’s how to do it:\n1. Open Command Prompt: Press the Windows key on your keyboard, type cmd and hit Enter.\n2. Execute the arp -a command: This command displays the IP and MAC addresses of devices on your network.\n3. Identify your Raspberry Pi: Raspberry Pi devices have MAC addresses that start with B8:27:EB:xx:xx:xx or DC:A6:32:xx:xx:xx. Find the device in the list with a physical address that starts with these characters - that’s your Raspberry Pi’s IP address.\nNote: These are the MAC address prefixes specific to Raspberry Pi Foundation devices. Your device’s MAC address may start with a different prefix.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‘WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!’\n\n\n\n\n\nThis warning message means that the remote system you are trying to connect to has a different identification from what your system was expecting. This often happens when the system has been re-installed or the SSH key on the server has changed.\n\nYou can fix the error by editing your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file and removing the old key for the Raspberry Pi. Here’s how to remove the old key:\nssh-keygen -R raspberrypi\nOnce done, try to re-establish the SSH connection.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Verify Your Pi’s Internet Connectivity\nTo confirm your Raspberry Pi’s internet connection, use the ping command followed by the IP address of a well-known site. For example, ping Google’s Public DNS Server by typing this command:\nping 8.8.8.8\nIf the Pi is connected to the internet, you will see lines starting with ‘64 bytes from 8.8.8.8’ and a summary of the ping at the end.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you’re using a network with enhanced security, such as a university network, you may need to register your Raspberry Pi’s MAC address. The following figure is an example of what I did using my university network. If needed, consult your network administrator or IT support for the specific procedures of your network.\n\n\n\nExample of a Webpage Used to Register a MAC Address at a University"
