## 2.1.3. Skill required {.unnumbered}

You should have a basic understanding of programming, specifically in R and Python. You should be able to write, edit, and debug code. If you need to brush up on these skills or are just starting out, I recommend the following courses:
Data Science: Foundations using R Specialization: 

- [Data Science: Foundations using R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r): This course will help you build a strong foundation in data science using R.
- [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python): This course is a great introduction to programming in Python and covers the basics you'll need for this project.
