# Data Structure

We will provide an overview of the WiFi dataset used for pedestrian behavior analysis. We will explore the structure of the raw data and discuss the key attributes that are essential for understanding and interpreting the dataset.

## Raw Data Structure

The raw data is typically stored in a structured format, such as a database or a comma-separated values (CSV) file. For this example, let's assume the data is stored in an SQLite3 database. The database may contain one or more tables that capture the WiFi sensing data.

Each row in the dataset represents a captured WiFi packet, and the columns provide various attributes of the packet:

- Timestamp: The timestamp indicates when the packet was captured, allowing for temporal analysis.
- Type and Subtype: These columns specify the type and subtype of the captured packet. In this example, the packets are management frames with a subtype of probe-request, indicating that devices are searching for nearby APs.
- Strength: The signal strength of the received packet is recorded in dBm units, providing information about the proximity of the device to the sensor.
- Source Address: The source address is the hashed MAC address of the device sending the packet, enabling device identification while preserving privacy.
- Source Randomized: This column indicates whether the source address is randomized (1) or not (0).
- Destination Address: The destination address is the hashed MAC address of the intended recipient of the packet.
- Destination Randomized: This column indicates whether the destination address is randomized (1) or not (0).
- Access Point Name: The name of the access point (AP) that the device is trying to discover.
- Access Point Address: The hashed MAC address of the AP.
- Access Point Randomized: This column indicates whether the AP address is randomized (1) or not (0).
- Sequence Number: The sequence number of the packet, used for ordering and identifying packets within a sequence.
- Channel: The WiFi channel on which the packet was transmitted.
- Sensor Name: The name of the sensor that captured the packet.
