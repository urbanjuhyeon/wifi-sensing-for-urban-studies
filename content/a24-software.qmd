# 2.4. Software Setup {.unnumbered}

This section introduces how to retrieve the necessary scripts from the GitHub repository and execute them for the setup of the Urban Sensing Service on your Raspberry Pi.

## 2.4.1. Retrieve Required Scripts

To set up the sensing service on your Raspberry Pi, you'll need to access the scripts located in the [urban-sensing-raspi](https://github.com/jhyeonpark/urban-sensing-raspi) GitHub repository.

Before you proceed, ensure that your current directory is `/home/pi`. If you're in a different directory, use the following command to navigate to the correct location:

```bash
cd /home/pi
```

Next, download the repository by executing the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jhyeonpark/urban-sensing-raspi.git
```

#### Short description of repository

This repository contains several files, which are briefly explained below:

```
.
├── install.sh
├── configure.sh
├── code
│   ├── default
│   │   └── start.py
│   └── ... (additional directories/files as needed)
└── README.md
```

- `install.sh`: This script automates the installation of the Urban Sensing Service. It handles tasks such as installing necessary system packages and Python libraries, setting up the Bluetooth logger, and conducting other initial setup tasks. 

- `configure.sh`: This script manages the configuration of the Urban Sensing Service. It sets up udev rules for consistent network interface naming and creates a systemd service to run the sensing service automatically at boot. 

- `start.py`: Located in the 'code/default' directory, this Python script is the main program for the Urban Sensing Service. By default, it configures WiFi monitoring on three different channels, collects WiFi packet data, parses this data, and stores relevant information in a SQLite database. It also collects Bluetooth data.

## 2.4.2. Install necessary packages

Once you download the repository, move your working directory to the repository with the following command:

```bash
cd urban-sensing-raspi
```

Switch to a superuser shell session by typing this command:

```bash
sudo su
```

Next, run the `install.sh` script by executing this command:

```bash
bash install.sh
```

## 2.4.3. Configure setting

run the `configure.sh` script by executing this command:

```bash
bash configure.sh
```

Once the installation script completes, proceed with the `configure.sh` script. This script sets up udev rules for consistent network interface naming and creates a systemd service to run the sensing service automatically at boot.

Remember to start the service again when you're ready to resume sensing operations.
