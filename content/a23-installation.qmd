### Step 2: Flash the Raspberry Pi OS onto your SD card. 
Before initiating the writing process, make sure to enable `ssh` and set the username and password to 'pi' and 'raspberry' respectively in the settings.

::: {.callout-note}
The default username and password are 'pi' and 'raspberry' respectively for Raspberry Pi OS, but it's always recommended to change these for security reasons once your system is set up.

Step 5: Use PuTTY 
opeen putty remotely access the Pi using SSH (Secure Shell), a protocol available on Linux systems that allows you to execute commands on the Pi from your local computer. This method enables you to access the Pi over an Ethernet cable, eliminating the need for a mouse and monitor. SSH should be enabled during the Raspberry Pi OS installation process (refer to Step 2).
