Step 5: Use PuTTY 
opeen putty remotely access the Pi using SSH (Secure Shell), a protocol available on Linux systems that allows you to execute commands on the Pi from your local computer. This method enables you to access the Pi over an Ethernet cable, eliminating the need for a mouse and monitor. SSH should be enabled during the Raspberry Pi OS installation process (refer to Step 2).

This guide the way to remotely access the Pi using **SSH**. The SSH is a protocol available on Linux systems to run commands on the Pi from your local computer. This help you to access the Pi with *a Ethernet cable* without a mouse and monitor. This SSH is enabled when the Raspberry Pi OS is installed at Step 3.
