# Preprocessing Techniques

With a clear understanding of the raw WiFi data structure, we can now proceed with data preprocessing techniques to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis. In this section, we will first demonstrate how to load the WiFi data into R and then discuss various preprocessing techniques to improve data quality and analysis results.



## Filltering Techniques

The three filtering techniques used for WiFi data preprocessing are:

**1. Removal of random MAC addresses:** Eliminates random MAC addresses to avoid duplicate counting.

**2. Removal of non-mobile devices:** Removes detection records of static devices to focus on mobility.

**3. Removal of rarely detected devices:** Excludes MAC addresses that are detected for very short duration.

### (Step 1) Removal of Random MAC Addresses

Random MAC addresses are identified by matching the OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) portion of the MAC address with a public database provided by IEEE. The OUI is the first 6 digits of a MAC address, representing the device manufacturer. Unmatched OUIs are considered random MAC addresses and are removed.
