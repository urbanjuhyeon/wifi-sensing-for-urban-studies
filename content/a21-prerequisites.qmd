# Prerequisites

Before beginning the process of setting up a WiFi sensor, it's essential to ensure you have the necessary hardware *(2.1)*, software *(2.2)*, and skills *(2.3)*.

## Hardware Components

This is the hardware setup illustrating the necessary components required for WiFi sensing:

The required hardware components for this WiFi sensor include:

| Hardware                | Description                                  | Specific Recommendation                       |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Raspberry Pi board      | Core of our sensor                           | Pi 3B/3B+ or higher                           |
| WiFi adapter            | Captures WiFi packets                        | Check chipset compatibility for 'monitoring mode' |
| Micro SD card and adapter | For system building and data storage       | At least 16 GB                                |
| Laptop and Ethernet cable | For accessing and controlling the sensor   | ---                                           |
| Portable power bank     | Powers the sensor in outdoor environments    | Battery capacity: +20,000 mAh                 |

Besides these essentials, other hardware components may be attached to the sensor depending on your project requirements, such as:

- **Pi camera:** This can be used to record the scene in front of the sensor.
- **Air pollution sensor:** If you want to monitor air quality in addition to WiFi sensing.
Temperature and humidity sensor: Useful for environmental monitoring and adjusting sensor performance based on climatic changes.
- **Temperature and humidity sensor:** Useful for environmental monitoring and adjusting sensor performance based on climatic changes.


## Required Software

The key software programs necessary to build a WiFi sensor and manage the sensor data are:

| Software                | Purpose                                           | Download Link                           |
|------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Raspberry Pi Imager | Tool for writing Pi OS images onto SD cards	 | [Link](https://www.putty.org/) |
| DB Browser for SQLite | Tool for view database written as SQLlite (WiFi packet file type) | [Link](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) |

Feel free to download these programs in advance. If needed, we will provide the download links again when each step requires these tools.

## Necessary Skills

Basic programming skills, specifically in R and Python, are required. You should be able to write, edit, and debug code. To improve these skills, consider the following courses:

-   [Data Science: Foundations using R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r) for a strong foundation in data science using R.
-   [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) to learn programming basics in Python.
