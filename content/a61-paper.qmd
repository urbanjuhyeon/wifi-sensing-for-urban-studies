## Recovering a Malformed SQLite3 Database {.unnumbered}

Are you facing the "database disk image is malformed" error in SQLite3? This error indicates a corrupt database file, possibly due to an application crash, hardware failure, or programming error. This guide will walk you through the steps to recover as much data as possible from a corrupted SQLite3 database.
## Step 1: Update SQLite3 to the Latest Version {.unnumbered}

To begin, ensure you have a recent version of SQLite3 that supports the `.recover` command. Introduced in SQLite3 version 3.29.0 (released on 2019-07-10), this command aids in database recovery. Download the latest SQLite3 version from the [official SQLite3 download page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) .

Download the `sqlite3.exe` file to the folder containing the malformed SQLite3 file.

## Step 2: Generate a SQL Dump with the `.recover` Command {.unnumbered}

The SQLite3 `.recover` command recovers as much data as possible from a corrupted database file. It parses the database file byte-by-byte and generates SQL commands to recreate the database.

Open the Command Prompt and navigate to the directory containing the corrupted SQLite3 file. Assuming `C:\Users\UNIST\Documents\malf` is the directory containing `broken.sqlite3`, the corrupted database, use the following command:

```bash
cd C:\Users\UNIST\Documents\malf
```

Then, use the `.recover` command as follows:

```bash
sqlite3 broken.sqlite3
sqlite> .mode insert
sqlite> .output recover.sql
sqlite> .recover
sqlite> .exit
```

These commands generate a `recover.sql` file containing SQL commands to recreate the database.

## Step 3: Recreate the Database Using the Recovered SQL {.unnumbered}

The final step involves creating a new SQLite3 database using the SQL commands in `recover.sql`. Execute the following command:

```bash
sqlite3 new_database.db < recover.sql
```



This creates a new SQLite3 database named `new_database.db` using the SQL commands in `recover.sql`.

> **Note:**  This method may not recover all your data, especially if the corruption is severe. Some rows or even entire tables might be missing or incomplete in the new database.
